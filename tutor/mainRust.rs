// Welcome to Cursor
//
// 1. Try generating with command K on a new line. Ask for a Rust implementation of a concurrent hash map.
// 2. Then, select the outputted code and hit chat. Ask if there's a bug. Ask how to improve.
// 3. Try selecting some code and hitting edit. Ask the bot to add a method for safely removing a key-value pair from the hash map.
// 4. To try out Cursor on your own projects, go to the file menu (top left) and open a folder.
